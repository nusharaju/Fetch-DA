# Data Cleaning and Exploration Project

## Overview

This project involves cleaning and exploring data from three CSV filesâ€”**Products**, **Users**, and **Transactions**â€”storing them in an **SQLite database**, and analyzing the combined dataset using **SQL queries**.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.

Install the required library **pandas** by running:

```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

## ðŸ“Œ Steps to Run the Scripts  

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Clean and Explore Products Data  

```bash
python products_cleaning_exploring.py
```
Description:

Cleans the PRODUCTS.csv file data.  
Explores the PRODUCTS table.  
Stores the cleaned data in an SQLite database for further analysis.  

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Clean and Explore Users Data  

```bash
python users_cleaning_exploring.py
```
Description:  

Cleans the USERS.csv file data.  
Explores the USERS table.  
Stores the cleaned data in an SQLite database for further analysis.  

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Clean and Explore Transactions Data  

```bash
python transactions_cleaning_exploring.py
```
Description:

Cleans the TRANSACTIONS.csv file data.  
Explores the TRANSACTIONS table.  
Stores the cleaned data in an SQLite database for further analysis.  

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Explore Combined Dataset

```bash
python combined_dataset_exploration.py
```
Description:

Joins the products, users, and transactions tables using SQL joins.  
Analyzes the combined dataset using various SQL queries.  
Generates insights to understand the data better.  

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Solve Open and Closed-ended Questions

```bash
python open_and_closed_ended_questions.py
```

Description:

Solves open and closed-ended questions using SQL queries.  
Extracts meaningful insights based on the dataset.
